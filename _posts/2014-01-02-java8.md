# New Features:
 * new Date and Time API(JSR 310)
 * Nashorn JavaScript Engine, Type Annotation(JSR 308)
 * Compact Profiles and Project Lambda (JSR 335)

## [Lambda][lambda] 
JSR335
support programming in a multicore environment by adding [closures][Closure] and related feature

### Closure
 * closure is a set of local variables, these variable will exist after function executed
 * function stack won't be released after function executed
 * define another function inside one function

Lambda expression:

Use it if you are encapsulating a single unit of behavior that you want to pass to other code. For example, you would use a lambda expression if you want a certain action performed on each element of a collection, when a process is completed, or when a process encounters an error.

Use it if you need a simple instance of a functional interface and none of the preceeding criteria apply (for example, you do not need a constructor, a named type, fields, or additional methods).



## Functional interface
TODO ..

## Stream
TODO ..

### java.util.stream
A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate
operations.  The following example illustrates an aggregate operation using

{% highlight java %}
 			personList
           		.stream()
                .filter(
                        p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE
                                && p.getAge() >= 18
                                && p.getAge() <= 25)
                .map(p -> p.getEmail())
                .forEach(email -> System.out.println(email));
{% endhighlight %}

A stream is a sequence of elements. Unlike a collection, it is not a data structure that stores elements. Instead, a stream carries values from a source, such as collection, through a pipeline. A pipeline is a sequence of stream operations, which in this example is filter- map-forEach. In addition, aggregate operations typically accept lambda expressions as parameters, enabling you to customize how they behave.

### java.util.function
TODO ..


## Nashorn 
A Javascript engine, replace Rhino 


## [Avatar][avatar]
>Project Avatar provides a JavaScript services layer zeroed in on supporting REST, WebSockets and Server-Sent Events, and a rich client side framework that assumes very minor JavaScript knowledge. The services side is focused on **building data services using JavaScript**, while the optional client side is entirely focused on supporting HTML5 and TSA (Thin Server Architecture).
