## Python 
Python supports the creation of **anonymous functions** (i.e. functions that are not bound
to a name) at runtime, using a construct called "lambda". This is not exactly the same as
lambda in functional programming languages, but it is a very powerful concept that's well 
integrated into Python and is often used in conjunction with typical functional 
concepts like *filter()*, *map()* and *reduce()*.


functional programming in python
``` python
>>> mult3 = filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> print mult3
[3, 6, 9]

>>> foo = [2, 18, 9, 22, 17, 24, 8, 12, 27]
>>> 
>>> print filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, foo)
[18, 9, 24, 12, 27]
>>> 
>>> print map(lambda x: x * 2 + 10, foo)
[14, 46, 28, 54, 44, 58, 26, 34, 64]
>>> 
>>> print reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, foo)
139

```
